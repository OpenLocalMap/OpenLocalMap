OpenLocalMap
============

This project aims to create a develop a simple WMS based web mapping application for use by local authorities that is controlled by metadata tables stored within a database or XML.  The project is also aims provide a method to deliver data and metadata if required. 

The project is built in HTML5 (so won't work in Ie8), PHP, jQuery, jQuery UI, Openlayers 3,  proj4js and uses currently an Oracle Database. 

The WMS layers themselves need to be hosted on a wms server (such as Geoserver) with a spatial database beind it. 

The ultimate aim is to provide a simple to use cross platform application that local government can quickly deploy to deliver spatial information. 

There is a early version of the application adapted for Hackney Local Authroity live at www.map.hackney.gov.uk/MapHackney3

In the future hopefully this will also work with MySQL, SQLServer,  Postgresql or a local xml file. There is a also a .NET version in the pipeline.
